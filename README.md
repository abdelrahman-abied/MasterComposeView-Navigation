A sample Android application demonstrating a practical, step-by-step strategy for migrating a legacy app from XML layouts and Fragment-based Navigation to a modern UI with Jetpack Compose. This repository provides the source code for the "Compose Migration" series of articles on Medium.

## Project Overview

Migrating a large, established Android application to Jetpack Compose can be a daunting task. A "big bang" rewrite is often impractical and risky. This project demonstrates a more pragmatic, incremental approach, allowing you to introduce Compose into your existing XML-based application piece by piece without disrupting your current architecture.

This code base covers three core techniques for a smooth and stable migration:

1.  **Integrating full Compose screens** into your existing XML Navigation Graph.
2.  **Embedding individual Compose components** within traditional Fragment XML layouts.
3.  **Building self-contained feature flows** entirely in Compose, complete with their own navigation, while ensuring seamless integration back into the legacy parts of the app.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Integrating a Compose Screen in a View NavGraph (`first_activity`)

This technique is the perfect first step for building new screens.
- **`ComposableNavHostFragment`**: Replacing the standard `NavHostFragment` to enable composable destinations.
- **`<composable>` XML Tag**: Defining a Compose function as a destination directly in your `res/navigation/nav_graph.xml` file.
- **`LocalView.current.findNavController()`**: Accessing the traditional `NavController` from within a composable to navigate to other fragments or composables in the same graph.

### 2. Using Compose Components in an XML Fragment (`second_activity`)

Ideal for modernizing parts of an existing screen, like a button, list item, or complex custom view.
- **`<androidx.compose.ui.platform.ComposeView>`**: A powerful View that acts as a container to render Compose UI within an XML layout.
- **`setViewCompositionStrategy`**: A crucial step to manage the composition's lifecycle and prevent memory leaks by tying it to the Fragment's view lifecycle.
- **`setContent { ... }`**: The block where you define your Composable UI from within your Fragment's Kotlin code.

### 3. Building a Full Compose Navigation Flow (`MainActivityCompose`)

The ultimate goal: creating entire feature flows that are fully declarative, managing their own state and navigation.
- **Compose `NavHost`**: Building a navigation graph entirely in code with a `rememberNavController()`.
- **Passing Arguments**: Navigating between composables while passing type-safe arguments.
- **Bridging Back to Views**: Handling the back press to gracefully exit the Compose-only Activity and return to the previous Fragment or Activity in the legacy navigation stack (`activity.onBackPressedDispatcher.onBackPressed()`).
- **Intercepting Back Events**: Using `BackHandler` to control navigation behavior within the Compose `NavHost`, such as showing a confirmation dialog.

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abdelrahman-abied/MasterComposeView-Navigation.git
    ```
2.  Open the project in the latest stable version of Android Studio.
3.  Build and run the project on an emulator or a physical device.
4.  Navigate through the app to see each of the concepts in action.

## Project Structure

- **`first_activity`**: Demonstrates Concept #1. An activity hosting a `ComposableNavHostFragment` with a mix of Fragment and Composable destinations.
- **`second_activity`**: Demonstrates Concept #2. An activity with two fragments, where the second fragment uses a `ComposeView` to render a button.
- **`MainActivityCompose`**: Demonstrates Concept #3. A self-contained, Compose-only activity with its own navigation graph that can be launched from the legacy part of the app.
